1. Would be nice to be able to deselect columns without clearing everything
2. Clicking multiple times on an already selected column adds multiple identical graphs
4. Negative numbers are not displayed correctly, e.g. select dcpagdf as one of the columns
5. Selecting another observation from the correlation graph doesn't add new line to longitudinal graphs which were already displayed
3. We will need a way of displaying categorical variables, both in correlation graph and in longitudinal graphs
6. Changing the time doesn't refresh the correlation graph => It works in FireFox.
7. It would be nice to be able to link variables from different files, e.g. so household values can be visualized for individuals
